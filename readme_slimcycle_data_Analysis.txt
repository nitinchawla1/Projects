1) Importing the dataset and do usual data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset
2) Detecting Outliers (using boxplot, “describe” method by checking the difference between mean and median)
3) Checking if features like marital status, age have any effect on the product purchased (using countplot, histplots, boxplots etc)
4) Representing the marginal probability like - what percent of customers have purchased KP281, KP481, or KP781 in a table (can use pandas.crosstab here)
5) Check correlation among different factors using heat maps or pair plots.
6) With all the above steps I have answered questions like: What is the probability of a male customer buying a KP781 treadmill?
7) Customer Profiling - Categorization of users.
8) Probability- marginal, conditional probability.
9) Some recommendations and actionable insights, based on the inferences.
